The aim of the course project was to create an automated fan control system using the microcontroller board [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno). The project was developed as part of an Embedded Systems/IoT course during my second year of studies in the Bachelor of Engineering program at XAMK UAS.

-
 + Pin 9 to adjust the DC motor's speed based on temperature. 
 + TMP36 sends analog signal to board via pin A0. 
 + Measurement is displayed on LCD, connected to board pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2.






The project was built using [Arduino IDE](https://wiki-content.arduino.cc/en/software), programming language C++. Schema Design made with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
